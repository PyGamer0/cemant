- [ ] documentation (+ rationale)
- [ ] sampling
- [ ] release (here and elsewhere)
- consider other similarly gray color schemes

- Colorimetrically and mathematically graceful
- Psychological values:
  - Prefer light contexts but compatible with both light and dark.
  - Prefer less long-term fatigue over more pizzazz.
  - Foreground should look clear, but contrast should not be too high.
  - Should feel "default" and "correct", but still have "personality".

*** research

- HSB, attention, preference :: [[http://www.thesis.bilkent.edu.tr/0001471.pdf]]
  - Max saturation generally catches most attention and is most preferred (but I guess also most fatiguing).
  - People generally prefer seeing blue (on any background).
  - Cyan catches most attention (on red and yellow).
  - Red catches most attention (on yellow, cyan, and blue).
- Creating color palettes :: [[https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/02/color-theory-for-designer-part-3-creating-your-own-color-palettes/]]
- HSL and HSV :: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV]]
  - Computationally efficient but not perceptually uniform.
- CIELAB color space :: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIELAB_color_space]]
  - Three-dimensional real number space, perceptually uniform with human color vision.
- Color theory :: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_theory]]
  - There is no absolute standard of color harmony and pleasurability (much less one for a coding environment).
    - 21st century conceptual model: =color harmony is a function of Individual Differences + Cultural Experiences + Prevailing Context + Perceptual Effects + Effects of Time=
  - "Neutral colors are easily modified by adjacent more saturated colors and they appear to take on the hue *complementary* to the saturated color." [my emphasis]
- Grey :: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey]]
  - Aka. unsaturated, achromatic, neutral
  - Generally the least liked color
